# IPAddress-Classes
Class definition for IPAddress and IPv6Address types<br>
The current version is a rewrite from the original. The previous version held the IP address in string form in memory.
The current version holds the IP address in numeric form (32- or 128-bit unsigned integer depending on the IP version).
The IPv6 class relies on the UInt128 class I have on this site.
